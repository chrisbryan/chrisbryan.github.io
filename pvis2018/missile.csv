The 1984 tests probably took place over the course of several months rather than on the same days as they are entered here. What we know though is that North Korea carried out at least 6 tests. We also know that the tests were caried out at Tonghae. We also know that 3 of the tests succeeded and that at least 3 failed. We do not know exactly which ones were failures and which ones were successes. We also do not know exactly when these tests took place except that it was between April and September of 1984. Readers should interpret the information about these first tests as our best estimates as to what occured in a secret program within one of the most secret regimes in the world. Information on tests after 1993 is much more complete than information on the early years of this program.

The test was the first known test carried out during Kim Jong Il's reign, it was North Korea's first known attempt at a multi-stage rocket, and it was the first North Korean missile test to overfly Japan. Overflying Japan produced a significant diplomatic outcry. This rocket however managed to make it out over the Pacific Ocean before spectacularly exploding at some point during its third stage. Parts of it are believed to have travelled about 4000 km before splashing into the ocean. However, North Korea reported it had successfully inserted a satellite into orbit on September 14, a few days after the launch. Pictures of the satellite were distributed to foreign media and the satellite pictured looked almost identical to the first Chinese satellite put into orbit (which itself looked very similar to the US Telstar). Despite these pictures and subsequent information about the satellite, no one was able to detect the satellite in orbit. Despite the failure, this test had significant consequences. It led to negotiations between the US and North Korea that resulted in a missile testing moratorium that lasted until 2006. It also probably served as a jump start to the US's ballistic missile defense systems. The overflight of Japan caused significant enough diplomatic trouble that North Korea began construction of Sohae on the opposite shore of North Korea. Since finishing construction in 2012, DPRK satellite launch attempts have been out Sohae and have been on trajectories which do not overfly Japan.","http://www.astronautix.com/g/gitdaeryung.html; http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/01/world/north-korea-fires-missile-over-japanese-territory.htmlhttp://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/north_korea_missile_2.pdf?_=1327534760; Joseph S.

The launch is also refered to as the launch of Kwangmyongsong-3, the satellite payload. The rocket was also the first rocket launched from Sohae, on the west side of North Korea and aimed south. This was presumably to prevent it from violating Japanese airspace. The rocket itself reached an altitude of about 120 kilometers before exploding about 90 seconds into launch. The debris landed about 165 km in the ocean west of Seoul. The test followed an Obama administration attempt to revive the missile testing moratorium (referred to as ""the leap day deal""). However, the resulting deal did not address space launches which likely prompted North Korea to carry out this test. The launch proved to be fairly embarrasing for the Obama administration which had pushed for a missile deal and the experience likely prevented further attempts at negotiating a missile or nuclear freeze with the regime.",http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/13/world/asia/north-korea-launches-rocket-defying-world-warnings.html; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwangmy%C5%8Fngs%C5%8Fng-3; http://www.astronautix.com/k/koreanorth.html

It was detected and tracked by United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM). Reportedly, South Korea did not detect the launch suggesting the missile exploded at a low altitude (before it could be picked up on South Korean radar). North Korea has also not released photographs of the test making it extremely difficult for 3rd party observers to confirm the location and the type of missile used in the launch. The test location was later located by finding the burn scars left by the test. The burn scars suggest that the October 15 test exploded on launch and destroyed the TEL transporting it (North Korea has since been much more careful with its remaining TELs). The type of missile tested at this test and the test 5 days later remains controversial. STRATCOM stated that it was a presumed Musudan. Later testimony by the DNI suggests that the US intelligence community has arrived at a similar consensus. It's possible though that the October tests were of any number of missile systems. The PK-2, tested successfully only a few kilomters away seems a plausible suspect. It could also have been an early test of the HS-12 , or perhaps some version of the KN-08. Considering the lack of hard evidence and the apparant consensus of the intelligence community, the October tests are entered as Musudans.

This missile's name is still slightly unclear. North Korea refers to this as the ""ultra precision"" missile. The missile itself appears to be a Scud-C with a Manueverable Re-entry Vehicle, hence the designation ""Scud-C MaRV"".  This test marked another first for North Korea in 2017. It was the first successful test of the Scud-C MaRV, a missile with a maneuverable terminal stage.  A maneuverable terminal stage is significant because such a system could potentially frustrate missile defense systems like THAAD. This missile was first sighted at the April 15, 2017 parade. This missile was initially believed to have been tested 3 times in April and failed repeatedly. Information has since surfaced that these were actually tests of the Hwasong-12. While this test is reported to have occurred at Wonson Kalma International Airport, the test actually took place right outside the airport, about 100 meters on the northern side.

There were multiple reports from US intelligence agencies that said North Korea was preparing for a missile launch sometime during the last week of July. However, most of those reports cited activity at Kusong, around where the first ICBM test was carried out. This test occurred over 100 km away from that location. Some have speculated that this test was North Korea's attempt to demonstrate that it could ""fake out"" US intelligence and carry out a launch without the US knowing where it would come from. Subsequent reports from South Korea and the US stated that the respective intelligence agencies were aware of and tracking the activity and were not fooled.

The first was in 1998 and the second was in 2009 (North Korea attempted a launch over Japan in 2006 but the rocket failed before overflying Japan). Initial reports suggested that North Korea launched 3 missiles, this was later deterimined to be innaccurate and that North Korea had only launched a single missile. The exact type of missile launched is unclear however we have can narrow it down. Based on the range alone it would have to be either the Hwasong-12 or the Hwasong-14 because those are the only known missiles in North Korea's arsenal capable of travelling that distance. The consensus is that this was a launch of the HS-12. The estimated maximum range of this missile is 4500 km making the 2700 km distance travelled puzzeling. The reduced range was likely either the result of some failure with the missile or North Korea purposely testing the missile at a reduced range (both of which are not without precedence).This is unclear. Early reports out of Japan reported that the missile broke apart into multiple pieces suggesting a failure. In addition, the missile travelled only 2700 km, significantly shorter than its estimated range. North Korea later reported the test as a success and released photographs of the test and Kim Jong Un observing it. Maps placed in front of Kim suggest the missile may have been intended to travel farther than it did. A subsequent test on September 14 followed a similar trajectory except this time the missile travelled about 1000 km farther.",http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2017/08/29/91/0401000000AEN20170829000755315F.html; http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2017/08/29/0401000000AEN20170829000752315.html; http://allthingsnuclear.org/dwright/north-koreas-missile-test-over-japan; https://twitter.com/nktpnd/status/902300202039738368; https://twitter.com/jseldin/status/902291268369305600; https://twitter.com/nktpnd/status/902604666646777861; https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/north-korean-missile-flies-over-japan-escalating-tensions-and-prompting-an-angry-response-from-tokyo/2017/08/28/e1975804-8c37-11e7-9c53-6a169beb0953_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-low_nkoreamissile-546pm:homepage/story&utm_campaign=buffer&utm_content=buffere55ca&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_term=.024311fb0d4a; http://www.mod.go.jp/e/press/release/2017/08/29a.html; https://www.facebook.com/36WGPA/posts/1772782709430433;
